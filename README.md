 #Warehouse Application
 
In this application i am getting data from  redux store .

In home page data is loaded from redux store. In this user can also filter data based on city,cluster_name and space_available.In this page user can also get data for particular warehouse name by typing in serach box.

When user clicks on particular warehouse card it navigates to Details Page . In this page user can see particular warehouse detalis and edit button. When user clicks on edit button he can also edit the data.Edit data is updated in the redux store.

In this i have used react-router-dom inorder to dynamically navigate through pages and i have used redux to share data to all the components easily
